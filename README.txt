	Implemented tasks:
1) Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from keebord
2) Add 3 animated objects which will interact with each other. Balls that have different velocity and moving angles. 
3) On interaction with each other, if they are of the same class (circle, square), they shuld change their color.
4) On interaction with the right and left wall (the margins of the window), they should be transformed into squares.
5) On interaction with the top and bottom of the window - the figures should increase their velocity.
6) For the task above, add balls with mouse.
